<h1>The Miracle (Of Joey Ramone)</h1>
<h2>By U2</h2>
<p>I was chasing down the days of fear<br>
Chasing down a dream before it disappeared<br>
I was aching to be somewhere near,<br>
Your voice was all I heard<br>
I was shaking from a storm in me,<br>
Haunted by the spectres that we had to see<br>
Yeah I wanted to be the melody,<br>
Above the noise, above the hurt.<br>
<br>
I was young<br>
Not dumb<br>
Just wishing to be blinded<br>
By you<br>
Brand new<br>
And we were pilgrims on our way<br>

I woke up at the moment when the miracle occurred<br>
Heard a song that made some sense out of the world<br>
Everything I ever lost, now has been returned<br>
In the most beautiful sound I'd ever heard.<br>
<br>
We got language so we can't communicate<br>
Religion so I can love and hate<br>
Music so I can exaggerate my pain, and give it a name<br>
<br>
I was young<br>
Not dumb<br>
Just wishing to be blinded<br>
By you<br>
Brand new<br>
And we were pilgrims on our way<br>
<br>
I woke up at the moment when the miracle occurred<br>
Heard a song that made some sense out of the world<br>
Everything I ever lost, now has been returned<br>
In the most beautiful sound I'd ever heard.<br>
<br>
We can hear you<br>
We can hear you<br>
We can hear you<br>

I woke up at the moment when the miracle occurred<br>
I get so many things I don't deserve<br>
All the stolen voices will someday be returned<br>
The most beautiful sound I'd ever heard<br>
<br>
Your voices will be heard<br>
Your voices will be heard</p><br>
